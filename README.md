# Team-Work-Problems-Analysis-Power-BI
# 📝Overview:
This project aims to analyze work problems faced by team members, classified into three levels: Personal, Department Level, and Company Level problems. The goal is to extract useful insights, generate KPIs to measure progress, and understand how to overcome these problems based on data provided by each team member. By summarizing the data, I created dynamic visualizations to represent problem distributions and their impact on our team's performance.
# 🛠️Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel <br />
- Power BI <br />
- Microsoft OneDrive <br />
# 🌐Data Source:
Each team member filled out a table in an Excel file, specifying the types of problems they face at different levels (Personal, Department, and Company), along with a weight indicating the significance of each problem. The Excel file was hosted on **OneDrive** to ensure accessibility for all team members.
# 🧹Cleaning and Preparing Process:
1. Created a structured Excel table with a dropdown list for selecting problem levels and names based on issues discussed during a team meeting. <br />
2. Each team member had a separate table to fill in their problem weights. <br />
3. Ensured all data entries were completed and accurate by validating each team member's input. <br />
4. Created a summary table showing the percentages of each problem across all team members for use in Power BI. <br />
# 🔍Analysis Process:
1. Imported the data into Power BI for analysis. <br />
2. Generated KPIs to understand the average percentages of problems at each level (Personal, Department, Company). <br />
3. Visualized the problem distribution in a pie chart to show average percentages for each type of problem. <br />
4. Displayed the details of each team member’s problems and weights in a table. <br />
5. Used a 100% stacked column chart to visualize the distribution of problem weights across different team members. <br />
6. Added dynamic filters to the dashboard: <br />
   - A dropdown filter for team member IDs. <br />
   - A text search filter for problem names. <br />
# 📌Key Findings:
- Personal problems account for an average of 16% across team members. <br />
- Department Level problems are the most significant, with an average of 52%. <br />
- Company Level problems constitute 32%. <br />
- The stacked column chart helped highlight variations in how different members weight these problems, providing a clear view of problem distribution across the team. <br />
